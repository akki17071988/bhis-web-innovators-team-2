<img src = "iFrame 2(img).png" height = "200px" width = "200px"><ul><h3><li> <u>Poverty:</u> One of the most significant drivers of hunger is poverty. Poor households lack the income to purchase food, access land for cultivation, or invest in proper nutrition.</li>

<li> <u>Conflict and Displacement:</u> Armed conflicts and political instability displace millions of people, disrupting food production and access to markets.</li>

<li> <u>Climate Change:</u> Changing weather patterns, extreme events like droughts and floods, and environmental degradation harm food production and exacerbate hunger in vulnerable regions.</li>

<li> <u>Food Waste:</u> Roughly one-third of the food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted. Reducing food waste is critical to improving food security worldwide.</li>
